# Superstore Sales Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes sales data from a fictional retail store called "Superstore." The goal is to uncover meaningful business insights through data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and customer segmentation.

The dataset (`Sample - Superstore.csv`) includes sales transactions, product categories, regions, profits, discounts, and customer information.

## Objectives

- Explore sales trends by category, sub-category, region, and time period  
- Analyze profitability and discount impact  
- Perform customer segmentation using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis  
- Create clear and informative visualizations  

## Tools & Libraries

- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook
